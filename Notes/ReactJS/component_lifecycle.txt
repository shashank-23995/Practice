Lifecycle Methods

class component lifecycle methods (These methods are not available on functional components)

we can classify lifecycle methods in four phases

1) Mounting - When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
Methods in Mounting phase - 
 - constructor(props)
 - static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) - when state of component depends on changes in props over time
 - render() - only required method. Read props and state and return JSX
 - componentDidMount - invoked immediately after component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM. Cause side effects. Ex: Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data	

2) Updating - When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either to its props or state
Methods in Updating phase - 
 - static getDerivedStateFromProps
 - shouldComponentUpdate
 - render
 - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
 - componentDidUpdate

3) Unmounting - Whwn component is being removed from the DOM
Methods in Unmounting phase - 
 - componentWillUnmount

4) Error Handling - When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component
Methods in Error Handling phase - 
 - static getDerivedStateFromError
 - componentDidCatch
