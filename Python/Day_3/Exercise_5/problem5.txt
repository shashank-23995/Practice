1. Which of the following are python floating point numbers? 1, 1.0, 1.12e4, -3.141759, 735, 0.57721566, 7.5e-3

--> 1.0, 1.12e4, -3.141759,0.57721566, 7.5e-3

2. What is the difference between integer and floating point division? What is the operator used for floating point division?

--> 

Difference
Integer division always return integer value even if number is not divisible
Floating point can return float value depending upon operations

/ is used for floating point division

3. What are the results of the following operations? Explain why

a. 1.5 + 2
-->result - 3.5
	one operand in above operation is float hence result is in float

b. 1.5 // 2.0
--> result - 0.0
	1.5 is not divisible by 2.0 and and we are using integer division

c. 1.5 / 2.0
--> result - 0.75
	1.5 is not divisible by 2.0 and but we are using floating point division

d. 1.5 ** 2
--> result - 2.25
	We are using '**' exponent operator 

e. 1 / 2
-->result - 0.5
	We are using floating point division operator

f. -3 // 2
--> result -  -2
	one operand is negative and we are using integer division operator

4. What happens when you evaluate 1 / 0 in the python console?
--> console displays following message

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

because division by zero is errorenous operation

5. What happens when you evaluate 1e1000? What about -1e1000? and type(1e1000)?
-->
1e1000
--> inf

-1e1000
--> -inf

type(1e1000)
--> <class 'float'>
