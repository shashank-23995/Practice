 1. Which of these fragments are valid and invalid first lines of if statements?
 Explain why ?

a. if(x > 4)
--> valid. if value of x is greater than 4 block will be executed

b. if x == 2
--> valid. if value of x is equal to 2 block will be executed

c. if(y =< 4)
--> valid. if value of y is less than or equal 4 block will be executed

d. if(x = 4)
--> invalid. = is not comparison operator

e. if(3 <= a)
--> valid. if a is greater than or equal to 3 block will be executed

f. if(1 - 1)
--> valid. 

g. if((1 - 1) <= 0) 
--> valid. 

h. if(name == "James")
--> valid.
