1. Describe the scope of the variables a, b, c and d in this example
def my_function(a):
	b = a - 2
	return b
c = 3

if c > 2:
	d = my_function(5)
	print(d)

-->
a & b are local variables
c & d are global variables

2. What is the lifetime of these variables? When they will be created and destroyed
-->
a & b are local to my_function(). Lifetime of these variables is only to this function.
a & b will be created when my_function() is called and destroyed when function executed completed

3. Can you guess what would happen if we were to assign c to a value of 1 instead
-->
if value assigned to c is 1 then if() block will not execute hence variables a, b, d will not be declared
